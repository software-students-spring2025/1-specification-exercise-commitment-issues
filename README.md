## Stakeholders

For our project, we interviewed Becky, a 21-year-old NYU student. They expressed a need for an app to make birthdays easier to navigate in NYC. They told us that a countdown would be helpful to know how many days it is until they get to celebrate their birthday. In addition, a list of many free things and discounts a person can receive for their birthday would also be helpful. Becky also said they want recommendations for places to go out to eat and drink with their friends for their birthday. Lastly, they really want to maximize their birthday experience. Some problems and frustrations Becky had regarding their birthday was indecisiveness. They never know what to do or where to go because of the limitless options. Also, since Becky is a student they are new to the area and need recommendations of where the “hot spots” are. It is easy to see online that a person receives free/discounted things for their birthday but it is frustrating that it is not all in one place. Becky said having an application like this one would help everyone get into the birthday spirit. Finally, having budget-friendly recommendations is a must for a college student living in NYC. 
## Product Vision Statement

The vision for The Ultimate Birthday Experience is to provide college students in NYC with the best recommendations for what to do for their special day through our Birthday Helper App!
